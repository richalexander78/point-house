    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<p><strong>Q: What is the best way to get across to the island?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Bring Your Own Boat - If you are traveling with your OWN boat you can pay, launch and park your vehicle at <a href="http://www.pinelandmarina.com">Pineland Marina</a>. If you did not bring a boat, there are <a href="recreation.html">several vendors</a> who offer boat rentals. <a href="http://www.islandgirlcharters.com">Island Girl Charters</a> is also a reliable water taxi that leaves from Pineland Marina. They have a staff of experienced, licensed captains - the boat ride from the marina to the island takes 20-40 minutes depending on the tides. 
	<p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Are golf carts available on the island?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> We're glad to say there are no cars on North Captiva Island! Yes, golf carts are a great way to travel and explore. If you are taking <a href="http://www.islandgirlcharters.com">Island Girl Charters</a>, request your landing to be <a href="http://www.barnaclesislandresort.com/barnacles-restaurant.htm">Barnacles Restaurant</a>. Be sure to coordinate th date and time with Island Golf Carts so they can have a cart waiting for you at the landing. The distance from the landing to the Point is about half-a-mile. You'll want transportation to your rental house. Call as soon as possible to make those reservations.
	<p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Is there a grocery store on the island?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> No. There is however, a small island “general store” called <a href="https://www.northcaptiva.com/about-the-island/dining/mangos-store/">Mangos</a>. It is great for the “forgotten item” but not to be used as a full grocery store. We strongly encourage you to bring your own groceries (packed in plastic bags) and water. There are grocery stores on Pine Island Road, which is en route to
	Pineland Marina - Publix, Walmart & Target.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Are there any restaurants on the island?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. <a href="http://www.barnaclesislandresort.com/barnacles-restaurant.htm">Barnacles</a> is open for lunch and dinner, serving good island fare plus beer and wine. <a href="https://www.northcaptiva.com/about-the-island/dining/mangos-store/">Mango’s</a> has a pool side bar serving a limited bar menu plus drinks. If you feel like exploring, there are waterfront restaurants on nearby islands, accessible by boat. Check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NorthCaptivaPointHouse">Facebook Page</a> for menus and pictures of some of these restaurants. We’re always adding more!</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Are fishing guides available?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. In addition to fishing, our favorite guide provides eco tours, bar hopping tours and shelling tours as well. A native of the area, Phil Kinsey of South Fish Private Charters (239.940.4371) can give you history and pirate information too!</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Is the water on the point safe?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. However, it is chlorinated well water. We suggest bottled water for drinking, and tap water for cooking and bathing. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND YOU WILL BE STAYING ON A BARRIER ISLAND. Water comes at a premium - keep your usage to a minimum to avoid problems with the water system keeping up with demand.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Are there bike, kayak and canoe rentals?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. For reservations and pricing information, please contact <a href="http://www.boatsandfun.com">Boats and Fun</a> - Located on North Captiva.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Are linens included?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Bed linens and bath towels are provided. We ask that you bring your OWN beach towels for outside use.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Is there a BBQ grill on the property?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes, both properties have a park-style charcoal grill. Charcoal is not provided.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Is a washer and dryer available?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> The Point House does have a washer and dryer for guest use. The Fish Camp does not.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: What do we do with our garbage?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> There are two large trash cans for the Point House and one large trash can for the Fish Camp. <strong>PLEASE REMEMBER,</strong> ALL TRASH MUST BE BARGED OFF THE ISLAND! Garbage should be secured in plastic bags before depositing in the garbage cans. Crush drink containers and break down boxes to avoid additional charges for garbage. Any garbage left outside the cans will cost you $10.00 per bag! Make sure the can lids are secure so the local critters don't make a mess.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Is there a fish-cleaning station?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. It's located on the Point House dock and has running water and electricity. Please clean the table after use, and  please <strong>DO NOT</strong> clean those delicious, juicy fish inside either house.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: What is provided in the kitchen?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> We try to keep the kitchens fully stocked with everything guests will need including; wine glasses, knives, pots, pans, china etc. If you notice something we've missed, let us know. Also, help us out by not removing items from the house.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: What do I do in an emergency?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Dial 911. There is a manned fire station on the island to respond to calls. The local phone numbers will be provided at check in.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: Are beach chairs provided?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Adirondack chairs are on the decks at both properties. Please don't leave chairs on the beach as extreme tides will relocate them.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Q: How's the fishing?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Amazing! You can fish right outside your front door.</p>
	
	<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
	<p>The T-dock is shared between the Point House and Fish Camp properties. Our wonderful guests have been respectful by docking with the other guests in mind. A clean fish-cleaning station and clutter-free dock are appreciated by everyone!</p>
	
	<p>We are on a septic system:
	<strong>Please! Do not dump cooking/fry oil or bacon drippings down the drains! Jars are provided to dispose of such items. It's a nasty job to remove foreign objects from the septic tank! All feminine hygiene products must be disposed of in the trash.</strong></p>
	
	<p><strong>Enjoy Your Stay - We promise you'll never find anywhere like it again!</strong></p>
